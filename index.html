	<h2>How Does Unemployment Happen?</h2>
  	<p>
    The answer is sort of complicated. This is because there isn’t exactly one reason for unemployment. Unemployment can be a result of location, the part of town that you live in, the building that you work in, or even the country that you live in.

		  Of course location isn't the only thing that can affect unemployment. Parts of who you are as a person can affect whether you get a job or not, things like your gender and race can play a part in being employed.
