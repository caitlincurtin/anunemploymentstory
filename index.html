	<h2>How Does Unemployment Happen?</h2>
  	<p>
    The answer is sort of complicated. This is because there isn’t exactly one reason for unemployment. Unemployment can be a result of location, the part of town that you live in, the building that you work in, or even the country that you live in. 

</p>
	  <p>
		  Of course location isn't the only thing that can affect unemployment. Parts of who you are as a person can affect whether you get a job or not, things like your gender and race can play a part in being employed.

		  We hope our animation will make a difference to unemployment to you, our audience, by showing you the worst-case-scenario. We know that seeing such a heavy topic presented so lightly can seem a little disheartneing, but we hope that with this you (and everyone else reading), will be more motivated to make a difference where you can, whether its learning and informing others of the cause, or working to end unfairness in the workplace.

	  <img src="image_16854017_setfloors.JPG" alt="The Floors" width="450">
	  <p>
		  We cycled through combinations of these three walls and floors to create different rooms for our animation to take place in, such as Big red's office, Mr. Blob's home, and outside. 
	  </p>
	  <h2>The Plot</h2>
	  <p>
		  In our story there are (roughly) four main events. 
		  Event Number One: Big Red Fired Mr. Blob from the company, this leaves Mr. Blob out of work for the rest of the story. 
		  Event Number Two: Mr. Blob tells his wife that he lost his job, Mrs. Blob is unhappy about this, so she takes the kids, picks up and leaves. 
		  Event Number Three: Mr. Blob slowly goes into debt and is eventually evicted from his home. After Mr. Blob is evicted from his home he ends up on the streets asking for spare change. 
		  Event Number Four: Big Red goes driving along the road that Mr. Blob is currently at, and picks up Mr. Blob now ex wife and two children. Very soon after Mr. Blob is.. lights out. 
		  
		  Below are some pictures of the original story board and first ideas for how the characters would look.

	  <h2>Tech Affects</h2>
	  <img src="image_TechCode.JPG" alt="Tech Code" width="450">
	  <p>
		  Our scenes are brightly lit, and we wanted it that way! To achieve this affect we used an LED light set to full brightness with different color lights to give different undertones in different scenes. In the portion of our light code here, we show Red Lights set to full brightness with was used at the very beggining of our animation when Mr. Blob is called into the office.
