	<h2>How Does Unemployment Happen?</h2>
  	<p>
    The answer is sort of complicated. This is because there isn’t exactly one reason for unemployment. Unemployment can be a result of location, the part of town that you live in, the building that you work in, or even the country that you live in. 

</p>
	  <p>
		  Of course location isn't the only thing that can affect unemployment. Parts of who you are as a person can affect whether you get a job or not, things like your gender and race can play a part in being employed.

		  We hope our animation will make a difference to unemployment to you, our audience, by showing you the worst-case-scenario. We know that seeing such a heavy topic presented so lightly can seem a little disheartneing, but we hope that with this you (and everyone else reading), will be more motivated to make a difference where you can, whether its learning and informing others of the cause, or working to end unfairness in the workplace.

	  <img src="image_16854017_setfloors,JPG" alt="The Floors" width="450">
	  <p>
		  We cycled through combinations of these three walls and floors to create different rooms for our animation to take place in, such as Big red's office, Mr. Blob's home, and outside. 
	  </p>
	  <h2>Tech Affects</h2>
	  <img src="LightAnimationJavaScript.eml" alt+"Tech Code" width="450">
	  <p>
		  Our scenes are brightly lit, and we wanted it that way! To achieve this affect we used an LED light with alternating white/green and white/blue lights to achieve that well-lit, crisp look in our animation. We made it so that our lighting would turn on when a loud sound was played.
